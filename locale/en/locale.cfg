solar-powered-floor-tile=Transmits power to adjacent powered floor tiles and to entities placed on the tile. Generates a small amount of electricity from the built in solar panels but has a movement speed debuff due to them being more fragile as a result.
powered-floor-tile=Transmits power to adjacent powered floor tiles and to entities placed on the tile also adds a speed buff.
powered-floor-tap=Transmits power and circuit signals to adjacent powered floor tiles.  (Not a tile itself.)
powered-floor-circuit-tile=Transmits power to adjacent powered floor tiles and to entities placed on the tile.\nTransmits circuit signals to adjacent Powered Floor Circuit Tiles and Powered Floor Taps.\n(Does NOT transmit circuit signals to items placed on it.)
