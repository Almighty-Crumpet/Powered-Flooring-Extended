Version: 0.0.5
Date: 06. 05. 2023
  Info:
    - Update changelog formatting to meet the in-game standard
  Major Features:
    - Added Network Flooring Tile that will spread the logistics network 1 tile at a time
      Useful for spreading your logistics network with your rails and leaving space for separate networks in-between.
      Very useful when used in tandem with Nodes for a rail city block network with bot logistics to unload/load trains
    - Added three types of nodes, which are simpler, smaller, roboports with their own specific functions
      Network Node: Has a small area of logistics zone, useful in city blocks separated from the main network but cannot house bots.
      Construct Node: Has a medium area of construction, useful when spread with the Network flooring as it will connect to the main network for building.
      Bot Node: Has no logistics or construction zones, only houses bots.
  Graphics:
    - Added more flooring styles
    - Temporary graphics in place for existing Nodes
  Features:
